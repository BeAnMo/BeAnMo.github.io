snippet: So much to do and so little time

So much to do and so little time.

I had a blog about 2 and a half years ago, detailing my journey to learn how to program and build software. Unfortunately, my old dev machine broke (it was an ancient Dell PC with a whopping 3GB of RAM) and lost all my previous posts (maybe a dozen or so).

So here's a brief recap since then:

- Got hired at an ad-tech startup in Chicago and was their sold developer for roughly a year and a half (now there's a small engineering team).

- Kept busy keeping up with the Javascript/web browser ecosystems. Most importantly I've been improving my knowledge of basics: HTTP/cookies/security (it's concerning how much much of these topics get glossed over, especially with an increasingly privacy-focused public).

- Experimented a lot (I churn out quite a bit of code within browsers' JS consoles) but scold myself for not having more to share. That said, I did publish an NPM package a while back: <a href="https://github.com/BeAnMo/json-find" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Json-Find</a>. I have plans for a much more sophisticated interface for to allow manipulated/transforming JSON structures, but other priorities pop up.

With that said, I'm going to remind myself to post at least once a week. If it looks like I'm late, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:bamorin00@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bug me</a>.
