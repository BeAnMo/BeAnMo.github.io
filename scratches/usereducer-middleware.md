- extend `useApiState` example
- explain redux middleware signature
  - `store => next => action`
  - store is current store state
  - next is next middleware in the middleware chain (think `nextDispatch`)
  - action is the current action
  - using `store.dispatch` to dispatch will send new action through entire middleware chain
  - `next` will only dispatch action to next middleware
- example middleware
  - logging
  - caching
  - paging
